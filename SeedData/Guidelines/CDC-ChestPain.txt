# CDC Guidelines for Chest Pain Evaluation

## Overview
Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits. Proper evaluation is critical to identify life-threatening conditions while avoiding unnecessary interventions.

## Risk Stratification

### High Risk Features
- Age > 65
- Known coronary artery disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypertension
- Family history of premature CAD
- Smoking history

### Pain Characteristics Suggesting ACS
- Substernal pressure or squeezing
- Radiation to arm, neck, jaw, or back
- Associated with diaphoresis, nausea, dyspnea
- Duration > 20 minutes
- Not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin

### Pain Characteristics Suggesting Non-Cardiac Etiology
- Sharp, stabbing, positional
- Reproducible with palpation
- Very brief (seconds) or very prolonged (days)
- Localized to small area

## Recommended Evaluation

### Immediate (< 10 minutes)
1. 12-lead ECG
2. Continuous cardiac monitoring
3. IV access
4. Aspirin 325mg (if not contraindicated)

### Within 1 Hour
1. Cardiac troponin (initial)
2. Complete metabolic panel
3. Complete blood count
4. Chest X-ray

### Serial Testing
1. Repeat troponin at 3-6 hours
2. Consider high-sensitivity troponin protocols

## Disposition
- STEMI: Immediate cardiology consultation, consider PCI
- NSTEMI/UA: Admission, risk stratification, cardiology consultation
- Low risk: Consider observation unit, stress testing, outpatient follow-up
