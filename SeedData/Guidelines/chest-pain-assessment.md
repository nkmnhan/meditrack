# Clinical Guidelines: Chest Pain Assessment

## Overview
This document provides evidence-based guidelines for the initial assessment of patients presenting with chest pain in ambulatory settings.

## Key History Elements

### Character of Pain
- **Crushing/pressure**: Suggests cardiac origin
- **Sharp/stabbing**: May indicate pleuritic, pericardial, or musculoskeletal causes
- **Burning**: Consider esophageal/gastric origin
- **Positional**: Think musculoskeletal or pericarditis

### Duration
- Seconds to minutes: Less likely cardiac ischemia
- 20+ minutes continuous: Consider acute coronary syndrome
- Hours to days: Musculoskeletal, anxiety, or other non-cardiac causes more likely

### Associated Symptoms
- Diaphoresis, nausea, dyspnea: Increase suspicion for cardiac cause
- Palpitations: Consider arrhythmia
- Fever: Infectious or inflammatory process

## Risk Stratification

### High-Risk Features (IMMEDIATE ACTION)
- Ongoing chest pain with hemodynamic instability
- ECG changes (ST elevation/depression, new LBBB)
- Elevated troponin
- History of CAD with similar presentation
- Pain radiating to arm, jaw, or back

### Moderate-Risk Features
- Age > 65
- Diabetes mellitus
- Multiple cardiovascular risk factors
- Prolonged rest pain that has resolved
- T-wave inversions on ECG

### Low-Risk Features
- Young patient without risk factors
- Pain reproducible with palpation
- No ECG changes
- Negative biomarkers (if checked)

## Recommended Workup

### All Patients
- 12-lead ECG (within 10 minutes if possible)
- Vital signs including bilateral blood pressures if aortic dissection considered
- Focused cardiac and pulmonary examination

### Based on Clinical Suspicion
- Troponin: Any moderate-to-high risk patient
- Chest X-ray: If pulmonary pathology suspected
- D-dimer: If PE clinically suspected (Wells criteria)
- CT angiography: If dissection or PE suspected

## Documentation Requirements
1. Character, location, and radiation of pain
2. Duration and onset
3. Associated symptoms
4. Aggravating and alleviating factors
5. Risk factor assessment
6. Physical examination findings
7. ECG interpretation
8. Clinical decision-making rationale
