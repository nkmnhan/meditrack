# AHA Heart Failure Guidelines Summary

## Classification

### NYHA Functional Classification
- Class I: No limitation of physical activity
- Class II: Slight limitation; comfortable at rest
- Class III: Marked limitation; comfortable only at rest
- Class IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without symptoms

### ACC/AHA Stages
- Stage A: At risk for HF but no structural disease or symptoms
- Stage B: Structural heart disease but no symptoms
- Stage C: Structural disease with prior or current symptoms
- Stage D: Refractory HF requiring specialized interventions

## Key Recommendations

### Medications (HFrEF, EF ≤ 40%)
1. ACE inhibitor or ARB (or ARNI)
2. Beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol)
3. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (if EF ≤ 35%)
4. SGLT2 inhibitor (newer guideline addition)
5. Diuretics for volume management

### Devices
- ICD for primary prevention if EF ≤ 35% despite optimal medical therapy
- CRT if LBBB, QRS ≥ 150ms, EF ≤ 35%

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Sodium restriction (< 2g/day for Stage C/D)
- Fluid restriction (1.5-2L/day if hyponatremic or volume overloaded)
- Daily weight monitoring
- Regular exercise (cardiac rehabilitation)
- Smoking cessation
- Limit alcohol

## Red Flags Requiring Urgent Evaluation
- Worsening dyspnea at rest
- Weight gain > 3 lbs in 24 hours or > 5 lbs in a week
- New or worsening edema
- Persistent cough or wheezing
- Worsening fatigue or exercise intolerance
- Confusion or altered mental status
